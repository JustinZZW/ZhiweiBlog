Hi, I'm Zhiwei. I'm a Ph.D. student in [IRCBC](http://www.ircbc.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I joined the Dr. [Zheng-jiang Zhu](http://www.zhulab.cn) Lab in 2015, and my research focus on ion mobility - mass spectrometry based metabolomics and lipdiomics.

Outside the lab, I enjoy the reading, traveling and basketball. BTW, I'm a loyal fans of ROCKETS~
