#### Self-introduction
Hi, I'm **Zhiwei Zhou**.  Now, I'm a Ph.D. student in [IRCBC](http://www.ircbc.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I joined the Dr. [Zheng-jiang Zhu](http://www.zhulab.cn) Lab in 2015, and my research focus on ion mobility - mass spectrometry based metabolomics and lipdiomics. <br/><br/>

Outside the lab, I enjoy the reading, traveling and basketball. BTW, I'm a loyal fans of ROCKETS~<br/><br/>
